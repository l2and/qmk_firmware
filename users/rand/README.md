# QMK User Configuration for [rand](https://github.com/l2and/qmk_firmware)
Tired of copying and pasting the same macros and tap dances for all my keymaps. Utilizing user keymaps functionality.
See: https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_userspace

* (WIP) modifying original settings to work in Pop_OS
* (WIP) still using default qwerty keymap, but wih dvorak selected in the settings. As such, shortcuts are modified to send the correct keystrokes using the default qwerty qmk base, but with dvorak selected in settings

### Secrets
There's times where you have macros you don't want to share like emails, an address you need but you always forget, passwords ðŸ˜±, & and private strings. Based off [drashna's secret macros](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/users/drashna/readme_secrets.md), it's now possible to do this. All you need to do is create a `secrets.c` file. Below is an example of how this is used.

```c
// secrets.c
#include "rand.h"

static const char * const secret[] = {
  "BLANK1",
  "BLANK2",
  "BLANK3",
  "BLANK4",
  "BLANK5"
};

bool process_record_secrets(uint16_t keycode, keyrecord_t *record) {
  switch (keycode) {
    case M_XXX1...M_XXX5:
      if (record->event.pressed) {
        send_string(secret[keycode - M_XXX1]);
      }
      break;
  }
  return true;
}

```
